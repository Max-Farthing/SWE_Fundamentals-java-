This program contains animal shelter records of all animals in the network. This program utilizes Model-View Controller and singleton design patterns. Users can add animal shelters to the network as well as animals, users can see animals and whether or not they have been adopted. All animal shelters keep detailed records of all animals. Not all work is my own but with the help of my partner during the project
